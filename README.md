# Nomad üê´

This README  documents whatever steps are necessary to get the nomad scheduling
application up and running:

* Ruby version ‚Ä¢ ruby 2.6.1p33

* Build/Run Instructions:
Fork and Clone this repositiory, cd into the backend folder & then start the program.

CLI start : rails s

View : localhost:3000

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

* Challenges : 
Multiple Coach entries in the database - iteration challenge.

Wanting to use React with a really cool NPM Scheduling module would have been a great visual highlight of my application. However, when I sketched my UI, it came to me I was over simplyfying. Kept it simple with Ruby hand coding.

* Extra Credit:
Showcase of video lesson materials from coaches. Adding javascript visual enhancement of mouse over animations. High quality imagery of coaches. Share button to iCal/Google Cal/Outlook. Shout out page for thanking Coaches.
